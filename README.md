[Play it here!](https://scottysseus.github.io/shrekunknowns-battleswamps/)

A game created by scottyseus, libjared, jronSomers, and endlessDreamHero for Ludum Dare 44 (theme: _Your Life is Currency_).

In this _Souls_-like battle-royale immersive experience, control your favorite Ogre, Shrek. Capture as many fairytale creatures as possible: their lives are currency to buy back your swamp.

Note to our fans: this game _is_ set in the same fictional universe as [our last game](https://scottyseus.github.io/due-process/).

## SHREK SCENE WHERE THEY SELL FAIRYTALE CREATURES

* you capture fairytale creatures and you put them to work
* you play as the guard captain and try to swindle poor peasants out of their critters
* you play as a peasant and you have to make as much money as possible out of your fairy tale creatures
* ALTERNATE ONIONVERSE you are shrek armed with a net to capture fairy tale creatures, attempting to capture enough fairy tale creatures and sell them into lives of harsh servitude in order to buy your swamp back
    * money can be spent on powerups (this delays victory)
    * fairy tale critters fight back (they can kill you, and you lose)
    * donkey is the final boss

## Game Play - start to finish

* shrek must capture fairy tale creatures
    * (Optional) avoid villains of some sort on the way back (similar to terraria)
    * creatures get stronger the more that you capture
    * creatures frenzy if you capture too many of their type
    * damage creatures to weaken them for netting (similar to pokemon)
    * (Optional) we can add a mechanic where the net gets damaged if you attempt to net strong creatures too many times and needs repair ($$$)
* shrek must return to the guard captain to sell his captured creatures
* next to the guard captain is a booth where you can buy powerups (Rumplestiltszkin)
    * Speed Power-up (this one times out)
    * Pacify Power-up (this one times out, turns aggro on sight to passive aggro, or gets rid of frenzy)
    * Stronger net (nice to have, more durability to the net)
    * Swamp Bubble Power-up (like Sonic 3's bubble, takes one free hit & *1.5 jump height)
    * Fairy Dust Power-up (Slow fall speed & adds a double jump whose height is half as much a          normal jump)
    * Big Fist Power-up (makes Shrek's attacks do more damage and knocks back anyone he hits a sizable distance)
* Creatures start relatively passive, just moving about on their own in certain paths
* Despite their passive behavoir the Creatures will retailiate if attacked by Shrek
* Shrek must attack the Creatures until they reach a certain threshold of health that makes them   catchable
* Once that threshold has been reached the Creatures can be caught with one hit of Shrek's net
* After a certain number of Creatures have been caught they become frenized and chase Shrek on sight
* Once they have been frenized then their heatlh increases and they attack more offten making them more difficult to catch
* Shrek has a fixed amount of health, if depleted completely then the game ends and the player loses
* Each Creature has a gold value attached to them when turned into the vendor 
* Shrek receives the gold equal to the value assigned to the Creature he turned in when he does so
* The game ends when Shrek obtains a set amount of gold and the player wins
