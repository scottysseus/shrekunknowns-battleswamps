A game created by scottyseus, libjared, jronSomers, and endlessDreamHero for Ludum Dare 44 (theme: _Your Life is Currency_).

In this _Souls_-like battle-royale immersive experience, control your favorite Ogre, Shrek. Capture as many fairytale creatures as possible: their lives are currency to buy back your swamp.

Note to our fans: this game _is_ set in the same fictional universe as [our last game](https://scottyseus.github.io/due-process/).
